As a practice exercise, this project is a basic chatbot made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Through a simple and uncluttered interface, users can communicate by typing messages and getting automated responses.  Because the chatbot is fully client-side, it is lightweight and simple to use in any browser without the need for extra configuration.  In order to practice front-end development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive styling, it is a good project for beginners. For more complex interactions, it can be further improved with APIs or AI.
